Rubics cube solver

Sebastian Shanus Code:
Parsed the text from code.txt into 6 two-dimensional arrays (rubiksparse.py)

Jay Reddy Code:
Wrote transformation functions to do a cube side rotation.

Howard Chen
I wrote the solve functions and the skeleton of our implementation of the solving algorithm.  Some methods are only partially complete but represent how they would be finished.  The algorithm to solve it does it by solving the first two layers, then the top face, then the final top layer.
